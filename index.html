  <head><h1 class="header">Global Warming: A Scorching Solution to Jurassic Park Fantasies?</h1></head>
<h2 class="subject">By Abhiram Ruthala</h2>

<article class="body">
  <p><b>MANHATTAN, NY</b>--In response to the recent spikes in temperature, scientists from the Empire State University have leveled their commitment towards learning such heat changes, including the famous researcher Dr. Edward Adonis. In a groundbreaking revelation, scientists have unveiled their latest solution to the impending doom of global warming: bringing back dinosaurs! Apparently, the scorching temperatures and rising sea levels are not enough excitement for us humans.
</p> 
  
<img src="imagegang.png" alt="Scientists have been sweating non-stop to fix this issue."> 
   <!--<p class="description"> <i>A scientist has been sweating non-stop while he works to deconstruct the problem
    </i>
  </p>
  --> 

  <p>At Manhattan’s top Ivy League University, scientists noticed abrupt changes in the temperature as they headed for lunch. It was reported that the ice in the machine started catching fire. “We noticed the thermometers on the buret spiking levels we’ve never seen before,” said Dr. Schwardhodden at the Engineering Technology Department at ESU. The organisms that they were testing beforehand were used to high temperatures, and as the temperature increased, some of the cells within the organism showcased signs of liveable movement. It was mainly the case for cells coming from dinosaur families.
  </p>

 <!-- <p>As a result, he said how global warming increased the temperature in his room, to the point where he’d have to eat ice cream to keep him cool.</p> -->

  <p> While most sensible individuals would assume that combating climate change means preserving our existing ecosystems, these scientific mavericks have decided to throw caution to the wind, or in this case, the steamy tropical jungles of the Mesozoic Era. Why should people focus on reducing carbon emissions when they can resurrect long-extinct carnivorous giants with a huge taste for human flesh?
  </p>
  <p>"The weather is growing to the point where it is much more similar to what the dinosaurs had experienced. It can cause the habitat to be “just right” for these creatures to emerge back onto Earth. Dinosaurs were used to much warmer climates millions of years ago, and the advent of global warming makes it suitable for the dinosaurs to emerge back," stated Dr. Adonis as he noticed similarities between dinosaurs and the present-day climate. Being thrilled at the prospect of resurrecting dinosaurs, they've failed to consider the small details like rampaging T-Rexes and dino-induced traffic jams.</p>

  <p> By conducting a Simpson's diversity index calculation, scientists were able to figure out the biodiversity of the dinosaur population with existing values. Their value came out to be 0.721 for all variants of dinosaurs (72.1%). They then figured out the rate of genetic drift by noticing changes in traits over generations. They conducted a lot of test crosses and created a comparison between the most and least expressed genes. They realized that global warming triggered the evolution of giant dinosaurs by finding evidence of rapid climate change and genetic drift from 185 million years ago.  By putting their efforts into this, they paint a vivid picture of Jurassic Park-like scenarios, filled with awe-inspiring T-Rex encounters and major herds of Brachiosauruses gracefully grazing on our lawns. Who needs a polar bear show and coral reefs when you can have a front-row ticket to a dino parade?
  </p>
  <p>
To investigate more into the evidence, scientists integrated paleontologists to understand the carbon-14 levels in dinosaur fossils. Scientists noticed some half-life changes regarding atom superposition due to the increasing temperature. “They look a lot more similar to the atom superpositions in us living beings,” said Dr. Kangden, a paleontologist from the New York School of Researching Arts. While global warming threatens the very most of our planet, the genius minds have decided that our best course of action is to streamline our efforts into a real-life Jurassic World experiment. Because who needs breathable air and a habitable Earth when you can have a toothy T-Rex grinning angrily at you?
</p>
  <p>
  </p>

 <!-- <p>Another major change is the increase in photosynthesis conductivity, which leads to more oxygen production. With the abundance of carbon dioxide, photosynthesis can occur a lot more. It can create the advent for more creatures to survive and live better. This would lead to an abundance of mitochondria, which can cause evolutionary traits to be shown better through natural selection. “It can bring back older evolutionary traits as many mitochondria existed as prokaryotic cells back then,” stated Dr. Adonis in his most recent <i>Twitter</i> post.
 </p> -->
  <p>
    After all, the chances of dinosaurs coming back is essential to the big picture of global warming. "We're not going to be able to meet these goals if we don't act accordingly," says Dr. Sarja-Devuelve. "The focus has always been, 'How do we harvest more fossil fuels?' We need to shift the focus to 'How do we treat dinosaurs when they emerge?'" 
    After all, what's a little T-Rex rampage when compared to the allure of seeing these prehistoric creatures stomp the world once again?
  </p>

  <!--<p>
    Traffic congestion caused by a roaming herd of velociraptors? No problem! The sheer spectacle of being chased by a pack of predators would surely make for an unforgettable commute. And the occasional neighborhood snack? That's just nature's way of cutting down the population. 
  </p> -->
  <p> In the face of rising sea levels, extreme weather events and dwindling biodiversity, we find solace in the fact that scientists are laser-focused on the significant task of resurrecting long-dead reptiles. Let us appload these visionaries as the lead us down a path paved with roaring dinosaurs and heavily dystopian amusement parks. Forget about reducing carbon emissions or investing in renewable energy; the true key to our survival lies in dodging pterodactyl attacks and running from ravenous raptors infesting the area.
   
  </p>
<p>
  <b>Update:</b>

The mechanism behind the increasing temperatures is still in the debates by scientists as they try to devise the most important cause. With the swagger of a Hollywood director and the subtlety of a brontosaurus, they proudly present their latest masterpiece: "Jurassic World: Climate Crisis." Again, forget about those renewable energy solutions or carbon reduction initiatives. Nothing conveys the message of a "green planet" like a T-Rex wreaking havoc on the local grocery store or a Velociraptor teaching driving lessons to unexpected drivers. Regional organizations such as SEAN (Scientific Engineering Association of the North) have devised plans with scientists to learn more about such effects. More over wind turbines, it's time to allow the roar of the prehistoric past to take over the fossil fuel-filled air.
